<p>My name is Wendel, I work with technology and I'm interest in some things like:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Data Science</li>
  <li>Machine Learning</li>
  <li>Python</li>
  <li>Post here every single line that I write</li>
  <li>Coding just for fun</li>
  <li>Explain to everyone that <b><h3>Han shot first!<h3></b></li>
</ul>

<hr>

<p>I <strong>love</strong> nerding out about creative coding, train some AI models and see how data is beautiful, so don't hesitate to reach out!</p>
